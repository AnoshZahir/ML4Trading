Overview:
---------
A portfolio is a collection of stocks (or other assets) and corresponding 
allocations of funds to each of them. In order to evaluate and compare 
different portfolios, we first need to compute certain metrics, based on 
available historical data.

The primary goal of this assignment is to introduce you to this form of 
portfolio analysis. You will use pandas for reading in data, calculating 
various statistics and plotting a comparison graph.

Task:
-----    
Create a function called assess_portfolio() that takes as input a description 
of a portfolio and computes important statistics about it. You are given the 
following inputs for analyzing a portfolio:
    
    * A date range to select the historical data to use (specified by a start and 
end date). You should consider performance from close of the start date to 
close of the end date.

    * Symbols for equities (e.g., GOOG, AAPL, GLD, XOM). Note: You should support 
any symbol in the data directory.

    * Allocations to the equities at the beginning of the simulation (e.g., 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.1), should sum to 1.0.
    
    *Total starting value of the portfolio (e.g. $1,000,000)

Your goal is to compute the daily portfolio value over given date range, and 
then the following statistics for the overall portfolio:
    * Cumulative return
    * Average period return (if sampling frequency == 252 then this is average 
    daily return)
    * Standard deviation of daily returns
    * Sharpe ratio of the overall portfolio, given daily risk free rate (usually 0), and yearly sampling frequency (usually 252, the no. of trading days in a year)
    * Ending value of the portfolio
